  <h2> Clay Pot</h2>
  <img src="./../images/clay.png" alt="clay pot" width="200">
  <p>Clay pots are porous, alkaline, eco-friendly containers made from natural clay, offering health benefits like mineral infusion and pH balance, while also enhancing food flavor and requiring slow cooking with less oil.<br/>
    They can be used for cooking or water storage, with different types ranging from unglazed cooking pots that require soaking to decorative garden pots.</p>

  <img src="./../images/plastic.png" alt="plastic pot" width="200">
  <p>Plastic pots are lightweight, durable, and versatile containers for growing plants, available in many sizes and styles like nursery, decorative, self-watering, and hanging options. Key benefits include portability, <br/>
    affordability, and good moisture retention, though dark pots can get too hot in direct sun, and it's important to choose pots with drainage holes and, for outdoor use, UV-resistant options.  </p>

  <h2>Metal Pot</h2>
  <img src="./../images/metal.png" alt="Metal pot" width="200">
  <p>Metal pots can be either cookware or planters, with both having distinct properties and uses. Cookware is made from heat-conductive but non-reactive metals like stainless steel or clad copper, while garden pots are <br/>
     often made from lightweight and durable metals with finishes to prevent rust and overheating. </p>

  <h2>Porcelain</h2>
  <img src="./../images/porcelain.png" alt="porcelain pot" width="200">
  <p>A porcelain pot is a type of durable ceramic ware made from a refined clay body, typically including kaolin, fired at high temperatures (\(1,200-1,450^{\circ }C\)). This process, known as vitrification, results in a hard, dense, and often translucent material that is less porous and more resistant to water and chipping than earthenware or stoneware.  </p>
